# DeepNLP_Forecasting: Chronos TS Adaptation with LoRA

This repository adapts [Chronos: Learning the Language of Time Series](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gerNCVqqtR) for efficient fine-tuning using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques.  
Chronos TS is developed by Amazon Science; this project extends its capabilities for research and experimentation.

## About Chronos TS

Chronos TS is a state-of-the-art framework for time series forecasting using language models.  
For details, see the [Chronos TS paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gerNCVqqtR) and [original repository](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting).

## About this Adaptation

This project adapts Chronos TS to support LoRA-based fine-tuning, enabling parameter-efficient transfer learning for time series models.  
Key changes include:
- Integration of [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) for LoRA support
- Scripts for fine-tuning and evaluation on custom datasets

## ðŸš€ Installation
To install with all necessary dependencies, including evaluation tools and PEFT support:

1. **Clone this repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cosmolejo/DeepNLP_Forecasting
    cd DeepNLP_Forecasting/LoRA
    ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**
    ```sh
    conda create --name .venv
    conda activate .venv 
    ```

3. **Install in editable mode with training and evaluation dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install --editable ".[training, evaluation]"
    ```

4. **Install PEFT and CUDA-enabled PyTorch**
    ```sh
    pip install peft
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
    ```
    > **Note:**  
    > The URL `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128` is for CUDA 12.8.  
    > Make sure to use the correct URL for your CUDA version.  
    > See the [official PyTorch install guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for details.

Now that your environment is set up, you can find scripts for fine-tuning with LoRA and evaluating Chronos models in the [scripts](./scripts/) folder.
