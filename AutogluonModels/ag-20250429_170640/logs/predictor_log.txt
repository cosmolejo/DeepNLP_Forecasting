Beginning AutoGluon training...
AutoGluon will save models to 'c:\UdeA\Deep NL\Project\DeepNLP_Forecasting\AutogluonModels\ag-20250429_170640'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.2
Python Version:     3.12.10
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.22631
CPU Count:          12
GPU Count:          1
Memory Avail:       1.07 GB / 7.37 GB (14.5%)
Disk Space Avail:   6.60 GB / 475.75 GB (1.4%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.
===================================================
Setting presets to: bolt_small

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': WQL,
 'hyperparameters': {'Chronos': {'model_path': 'bolt_small'}},
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 1,
 'prediction_length': 1,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
 'random_seed': 123,
 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'skip_model_selection': True,
 'target': 'target',
 'verbosity': 2}

Inferred time series frequency: 'D'
Provided train_data has 3655 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 3655 (min=3655, max=3655). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
===================================================

Starting training. Start time is 2025-04-29 19:06:40
Models that will be trained: ['Chronos[bolt_small]']
Training timeseries model Chronos[bolt_small]. 
	0.01    s     = Training runtime
Training complete. Models trained: ['Chronos[bolt_small]']
Total runtime: 0.06 s
Best model: Chronos[bolt_small]
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: Chronos[bolt_small]
