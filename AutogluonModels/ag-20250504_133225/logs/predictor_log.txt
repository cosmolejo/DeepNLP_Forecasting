Setting presets to: bolt_small

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': WQL,
 'hyperparameters': {'Chronos': {'model_path': 'bolt_small'}},
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 1,
 'prediction_length': 9,

 'random_seed': 123,
 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'skip_model_selection': True,
 'target': 'target',
 'verbosity': 2}

Inferred time series frequency: 'D'
Provided train_data has 3655 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 3655 (min=3655, max=3655). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
